The missing Abstract Model in Nette framework without dependency (external) but with power, flexibility &amp; features you would love to use so much. @nette

Hello there,

I was using the framework for the past couple of days. The feelings are mixed. Sometimes I feel like I'm having all the needed feature just from one provider & which are perfectly combined together to form a full-stack framework. However, I really miss an ORM built-it for it. I also miss a cli in nette framework. Hopefully it will have those overtime.

As I already started one of my project with the framework, I needed some ways to find out how it's going to happen. There is enough possibilities with the framework but it doesn't have an huge active community right now, using English.

The lack of implementing models in proper way is what bothered me a lot. The repository pattern, factory pattern or just models, I'm confused to what I should do. Maybe I just began my journey with it, so it's confusing me.

I just wanted to make a simple, flexible but powerful handy Model Abstraction extension for it, mainly inspired from CodeIgniter 4.*.

Right now, I need really need some contribution. The forum thread is here: https://forum.nette.org/en/33486-nette-model-the-missing-abstract-model-new-extension

Here's what I've done/planned done so far:

  - Basic Finders (ok)
  - Advanced Finders (@todo)
  - Create, Insert, Delete (ok)
  - Soft Delete (@dev)
  - Timestamps Behavior (@dev)
  - Auto-detect Model Name (ok)
  - Entity Support(@todo)
  - Use only nette components (ok)
  - Keep it minimal but most usable (ok)
  - Hassle free usage
Give me your thoughts on it. I'll need some more time to set up the repo properly to be installed via composer.
But take look at least on the repo. Hopefully, it will be updated overtime.
