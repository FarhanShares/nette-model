  - Soft Delete (ok)
  - Timestamps Behavior (ok)
  - Auto-detect Model Name (ok)
  - Use only nette components (ok)
  - Keep it minimal but most usable (ok)
  - Hassle free usage (ok)
  
  - Advanced Finders (@todo)
  - Entity Support(@todo)
  
Inspired From Codeignitet4. Give me your thoughts on it. I'll need some more time to set up the repo properly to be installed via composer.
But take look at least on the repo. Hopefully, it will be updated overtime.
